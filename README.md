## 📌 Executive Summary
This repository serves as a technical portfolio demonstrating advanced proficiency in **Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL)**. It showcases the ability to transform raw data into actionable business insights through complex querying, optimization techniques, and automated procedures.

The project simulates real-world scenarios faced by Data Analysts and Engineers, including **Customer Segmentation (RFM)**, **Sales Trend Analysis**, **Data Cleansing Pipelines**, and **Automated Reporting**.

## 📂 Project Modules & Business Scenarios

### 1️⃣ [Data Consolidation & Integrity](./01_Joins_and_Basics.sql)
**Business Scenario:** Combining disparate data sources (Customers & Orders) while identifying data gaps.
- **Techniques:** Inner, Left, Right, Full Joins.
- **Highlight:** Used **Anti-Joins** to perform "Churn Analysis" (identifying customers who haven't purchased) and integrity checks for orphaned orders.

### 2️⃣ [Data Cleaning & Transformation (ETL)](./02_Data_Cleaning_and_Dates.sql)
**Business Scenario:** Preparing messy raw data for BI reporting.
- **Techniques:** String manipulation (`TRIM`, `REPLACE`), Date standardization (`FORMAT`, `EOMONTH`).
- **Highlight:** Implemented dynamic logic to handle NULL values in financial calculations to prevent reporting errors.

### 3️⃣ [Financial Modeling & Trend Analysis](./03_Window_Functions_Analytics.sql) ⭐ *(Core Module)*
**Business Scenario:** "How are we performing compared to last month?" & "Who are our top 20% customers?"
- **Techniques:** - **Running Totals:** Calculated cumulative sales per region.
    - **MoM Growth:** Used `LAG()` to calculate the percentage change in revenue.
    - **Segmentation:** Used `NTILE(3)` to group customers into High, Medium, and Low value (RFM approach).
    - **Pareto Principle:** Identified products driving the top 80% of revenue.

### 4️⃣ [Hierarchical Data & Optimization](./04_CTEs_Views_Subqueries.sql)
**Business Scenario:** Managing complex organizational structures and modularizing code.
- **Techniques:**
    - **Recursive CTEs:** Built an employee organizational chart (Manager vs. Subordinate) dynamically.
    - **Views:** Created security layers to abstract complex joins from end-users.

### 5️⃣ [Automation & Robust Execution](./05_Stored_Procedures.sql)
**Business Scenario:** Automating the "Monthly Sales Summary" report generation.
- **Techniques:** Stored Procedures with dynamic parameters.
- **Highlight:** Implemented robust **Error Handling** (`TRY...CATCH`) to log failures and ensure pipeline reliability.
